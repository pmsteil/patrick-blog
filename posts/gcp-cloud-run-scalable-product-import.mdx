Ok, so lately I've been having all kinds of fun with random projects. 


## GCP Cloud Run Scalable Product Catalog Import API Proof of Concept

I created a proof of concept for a client to show a Python API
which could be scaled up to process tens of thousands of requests
per day.  

I started out thinking we would use GCP Pub/Sub with a Cloud Run microservice, 
but PubSub was acting very strange.  It was very slow adding new items onto the queue.
Also tested with NodeJS and it was also slow.

So then I switched to use GCP Cloud Tasks, which was amazing!  It was super fast and
easy to use.  I was able to create a scalable API that could process 1000s of requests
per second.  Even when putting 55K messages on the task queue, I was queing them
at a rate of 0.0000145 ms per message.  That's 0.0145 ms per 1000 messages.  That's
fast enough to process 1000s of requests per second.

Look forward to creating a highly scalable product catalog import system!  
Now to find out how quickly BigCommerce can ingest on it's side handling a TON
of simultaneous requests.
