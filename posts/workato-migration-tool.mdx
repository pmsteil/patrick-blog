Ok, so lately I've been having all kinds of fun with random projects. 


## Workato Migration Script

Been learning a TON of Python.  I created a project to ingest WORKATO manifest (backup) files in JSON
format and convert it to actual Python and Ruby code that could then 
be used to create the same functionality as the Workato recipes, but running
in the Cloud. 

This would allow a client to migrate their Workato recipes to a more cost 
effective, fast, and flexible platform.
