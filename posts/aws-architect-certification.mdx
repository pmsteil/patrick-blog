Ok, so lately I've been having all kinds of fun with random projects. 


## AWS Architect Certification

Been studying for the AWS Architect Certification.  Seems I know more than I thought :)

I found a random 10 question quiz on the AWS site and got 7/10.  I was pretty happy about that.  
But certainly also learning a lot.  Finally learned what subnets are and how subnet masks work, lol.
Never wanted to be a "networking guy", but I guess I have to learn some of that to be AWS Cerfified.

I have been using the following resources:
