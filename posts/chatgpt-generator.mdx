Ok, so lately I've been having all kinds of fun with random projects. 


## Chat GPT-3 Generator (I call it Chad :)

This is a work in progress tool to generate text for blog posts or any other
kind of text on a regular basis.  It uses the GPT-3 API from OpenAI. 

It allows us to define a per company info, then a per project prompt and then
a list of keywords that go along with each project.  It then generates a
blog post based on the company info, project prompt and keywords.  It's pretty cool!

It can generate content every day, or can be configured to generate content
every 3 days, or every 7 days, etc.  And each keyword can be configured with
a priority so they get generated in the order you specify.

It will continue to cycle through all the keywords without generating the same
content for a keyword twice in a row.

And then it can be configured as to how often it can repeat the generation for a
keyword.  So you can set it to 30 days and it will only max generate content for that
keyword every 30 days.

Have lots of the TODO list for that project, but it's coming along nicely.
