## Workato to AWS Step Functions Project

Ah yah, now this could be a game changer.

Migrate your Workato recipes to AWS Step Functions!

AWS Step Functions supports hundreds! of the AWS Services
and allows you to build a workflow via a [visual editor](https://share.cleanshot.com/g0RRmWJG)

The output of the workflow is a JSON object that could obviously 
be generated by my [Workato Migration Tool](workato-migration-tool.mdx)!






## What is AWS Step Functions?

AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the services
of AWS cloud applications and microservices using visual workflows.
